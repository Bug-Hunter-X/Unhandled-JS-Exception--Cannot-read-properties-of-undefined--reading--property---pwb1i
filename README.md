# Unhandled JS Exception: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property') in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: "Unhandled JS Exception: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')".  The error arises when accessing a property of an object that is undefined or null. This often happens when dealing with asynchronous data or components rendering before data is loaded.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides solutions using optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
